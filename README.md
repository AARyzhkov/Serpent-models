# Serpent Models

This repository holds Serpent models and the results of their simulations. The models are based upon open information, and each model is considered as a subject of further improvements.

## Structure

Each folder relates to a corresponding reactor type containing folders with different projects. The folders contain other folders, which might relatate to different levels of complexity from a pincell to a full core. These folders for each level include subfolders with different parameters applied to a simulation.
