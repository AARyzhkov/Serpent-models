# MOX3600

This folder includes the full core models of MOX3600 with the EOEC fuel composition. The model is generally based upon the public domain and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency benchmark:

> NEA, 2015. Benchmark for Neutronic Analysis of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor Cores with Various Fuel Types and Core Sizes (No. NEA/NSC/R(2015)9). OECD Publishing, Paris.

The reference solution was obtained via Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1. The result is in good agreement with the following work:

> Bostelmann, F., 2020. Systematic Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor Systems (Doctoral dissertation). Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.
