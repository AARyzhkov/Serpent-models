# MET1000 

This folder includes the full core models of MET1000 (also known as ABR1000) with the EOEC fuel composition. The model is based upon the following works:

> Bostelmann, F., 2020. Systematic Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor Systems (Doctoral dissertation). Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

> Bostelmann, F., Ilas, G., Celik, C., Holcomb, A.M., Wielselquist, W.A., 2021. Nuclear Data Assessment for Advanced Reactors (No. ORNL/TM-2021/2002). Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, US.

The main difference introduced in our model is the redundunt layer of control rods in the control rod assemblies is removed. 

The reference solution was obtained via Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1. The result is in good agreement with the following work:

> Bostelmann, F., 2020. Systematic Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor Systems (Doctoral dissertation). Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.
